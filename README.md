# Blog Web Application

This repository contains the code for a simple **Blog Web Application** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. The application provides a platform where users can create and view blog posts in a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Features
- **Create Blog Posts:** Users can write and publish their blog posts with a title and content.
- **View Blog Posts:** All published posts are displayed on the homepage, where users can click on a post to read the full content.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering:** Uses **EJS** for rendering dynamic templates, making the application interactive and responsive.
- **Session-based Storage:** Posts are stored temporarily and will not persist between sessions as this version does not use a database.
- **Modern Styling:** Focus on styling and user experience to create an intuitive and appealing interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for building the server and handling requests.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and middleware integration.
